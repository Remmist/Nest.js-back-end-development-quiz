# Backend API based on NestJS and GraphQL for quiz app

Backend API for quiz application written based on NestJS framework using GraphQL. This API has the following functions:

* Create a new quiz. You can create a new quiz using mutation, which will enter all the data into the database.

* Get questions for a quiz. You can get all the required questions from the quiz using query, along with their answer choices.

* Check answers. You can also check all your answers to the quiz, getting the result at the end in the form of the maximum possible points and your scored points. Points are counted for each question where all correct answers are selected.

(Examples will be below)
## How to start the application?

1.	First, you need to install docker to run the database container. https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
2.	You need to install NestJS. Instructions on how to install the NestJS: 
https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps

3.	Next, you need to create database containers in docker. You can do this by opening the terminal or console in the project directory and write the following command: 
```console
docker-compose up -d â€“build
```
4.	You need to create a database using pgAdmin. You can open it by clicking this button in docker desktop or by going to the following address: http://127.0.0.1:5050/browser/

5.	Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt (opened in the project directory) to start the application:
```console
nest start
```
6.	Once the app is running, you can click on the link: http://localhost:3000/graphql and enter your queries or mutations according to the scheme, to verify operation.

## Examples of GraphQL queries and mutations:

### Create a new quiz:
```graphql
mutation CreateQuiz($quiz: CreateQuizInput!) {
  createQuiz(createQuizInput: $quiz){
    id
    name
    questions{
      description
      answers{
        description
      }
    }
    questions_sorting{
      description
      answers_sorting{
        description
      }
    }
    questions_own{
      description
    }
  }
}
```
